Information Gathered:
- The Chat component in src/pages/Chat/index.jsx is a React functional component managing chat functionality.
- It uses many useState hooks for profile, friends, messages, socket, typing indicators, friend requests, group creation, and UI state.
- There are some duplicate or redundant handlers and state updates, such as:
  - Multiple useEffect hooks that update refs for profile and selectedUser.
  - Some empty or redundant useEffect hooks.
  - Potential duplicate or overlapping message handling logic.
  - Some commented-out or disabled code related to group chat selection.
- The socket connection is initialized multiple times (connectSocket called on mount and on user select).
- Some functions like onMessageRead have empty handlers.
- Some state variables or handlers may be unused or can be simplified.

Plan:
- Remove redundant useEffect hooks that do not perform any action.
- Consolidate useEffect hooks that update refs into one.
- Remove duplicate or unnecessary socket event handlers or empty handlers.
- Simplify message handling logic to avoid duplicate or overlapping code.
- Remove commented-out or disabled code that is not currently used.
- Ensure socket connection is initialized only once.
- Clean up state variables that are unused or redundant.
- Review and simplify friend request handling if possible.
- Remove any other obvious duplicate or unwanted code.

Dependent Files to be Edited:
- None identified. Changes are limited to src/pages/Chat/index.jsx.

Follow-up Steps:
- After editing, test chat functionality thoroughly to ensure no regressions.
- Verify socket connection and message handling work as expected.
- Verify UI elements like friend requests, group creation, and chat list behave correctly.

Please confirm if you approve this plan to proceed with the cleanup.
